I am a bioinformatics minion interested in learning JavaScript, and I hope I can make some useful tools along the way to help bring more bioinformatics to the browser, and free for everyone, even people using ti for profit ... Thanks Apache 2.0 License!\r\n\r\n### The project\r\nThe plan here is to make useful and intuitive classes.  I'm generally a python programmer by trade, and I appreciate intuitive modules and classes; I think ECMAScript5 'strict' provides a framework that can be reasonably done in.  Ultimately we should be able to do some handy classes and generator functions that may be really useful.  Which ones?\r\n* Sequence\r\n* Range\r\n* Annotation\r\n* Alignment\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis project was started in 2016, Jason L Weirather (@jason-weirather).  There is a [wiki manual](https://github.com/jason-weirather/js-seq-tools/wiki), but if you have trouble or have questions, please contact me!\r\n",
